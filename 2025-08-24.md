# Weekly Log – 2025-08-24

## Summary of Activities

### 18.08
- Learned **scientific logging** for ROS2 systems in Python and documented insights in the master document  
- Implemented **scientific logging factory** in code  
  - Remaining task: integrate logging usage in relevant classes  

### 19.08
- Completed **logging branch commit**  
  - Logging fully learned, documented, and implemented  
  - Minor installation bugs fixed  
- Created **final project branch** for project completion and structured to-dos:  
  - Improve all code comments  
  - Add try-catch blocks where missing  
  - Generate dependency file for installation on external systems  
  - Overhaul README with:  
    - Graphics  
    - Clear explanatory texts  
    - Functional overview and relationships  
    - Notes on extensibility  
  - Optional: add specific class documentation if README becomes too dense  
- Added missing try-catch blocks to all classes  
- Reviewed and improved comments across all classes  

### 20.08
- Generated `requirements.txt`  
- Removed old logging class after verifying it was unused  
- Significant progress on **README** finalization  
- Created GitHub issues for remaining items before submitting project for application  

### 21.08
- Designed **package diagram**  
- Refined documentation texts  
- Captured screenshots and GIFs for documentation  
- Added XML metadata and license information in `setup.py`  

### 22.08
- Continued **README** improvements  
- Created new diagram for **ROS2 × PyTrees pipeline**  
- Planned follow-up project for the framework:  
  > "A dedicated hardware project building upon this framework is currently planned.  
  > The goal is to control a simple, stationary robot arm using **simulated neuromorphic sensors**.  
  > These sensors will be implemented using conventional hardware (e.g. ESP32), but will emulate neuromorphic behavior through event-driven signal processing.  
  > The robot arm will support four distinct movement patterns, each of which can be executed either **continuously** or as a **single-shot** action.  
  > This future work aims to validate the current software stack on real hardware and explore the integration of neuromorphic-inspired input into behavior tree–based control."  
- README nearly finalized: all texts revised, graphics embedded  
- Remaining tasks:  
  - Adjust graphic sizes  
  - Add graphic captions  
  - Position graphics correctly

## Key Insights

- Proper integration of **scientific logging** ensures traceable behavior across ROS2 systems  
- Comprehensive **documentation**, including diagrams, screenshots, and GIFs, greatly improves readability and maintainability  
- Planning **future hardware projects** in parallel keeps the software framework forward-compatible  

---

## Challenges & Fixes

- **Installation bugs during logging branch**  
  ✔ Fixed minor issues, nothing critical  
- **Old logging class cluttering project**  
  ✔ Verified unused and removed  
- **Incomplete try-catch coverage**  
  ✔ Added across all classes  
- **Final README formatting**  
  ✔ Embedded graphics, refined texts, tracked remaining layout adjustments

## Next Steps

- Complete final adjustments in README: graphics sizing, captions, and positions
