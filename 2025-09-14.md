# Weekly Log – 01.09 – 14.09

## Overview
During the past two weeks I have not conducted active work on my AI or robotics projects. The reason is the intensive preparation for upcoming university exams.  

## Focus
- Concentration on academic material relevant to the examinations  
- Prioritizing the long-term foundation to strengthen future research in AI and robotics  

## Reflection
Although no immediate progress on my projects can be documented during this period, I consider the exam phase an essential part of my development as a researcher. Building a strong theoretical base is crucial for my long-term work in AI and robotics.  

## Next Steps
After completing the exams, I will resume the regular research work on my projects and make productive use of the time that was paused.
