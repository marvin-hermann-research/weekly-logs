# Weekly Log – 2025-08-31

## Summary of Activities

### 25.08
- Finalized **README** and adjusted graphics according to plan
- Completed **final upload and merge** of the project repository
  - Encountered minor merge issues:
    - Incorrect image path for one graphic
    - Adjusted widths of some images that were too small
    - Some class comments were not carried over
  - Resolved all issues and performed final commit
- Project is now fully polished and publicly available on GitHub with comprehensive documentation

### 26.08
- Cleaned up Git repositories and removed unsanitary files
- Processed all pending issues, mainly related to **legacy repository creation**
- Fixed **TOC** and refined all repository READMEs

### 27.08
- Prepared **legacy repositories**
- Considered adding two additional projects to GitHub but opted not to due to code quality concerns
- Decided to upload executable for older projects instead of legacy code

### 28.08
- Added **Pneuma Planner Mobile** repository
- Added **Pseudo-Neuromorphic Sensor Framework** repository

### 29.08
- Closed all pending issues:
  - Uploaded **Reddit Video Generator**, **Who Wants to Be a Millionaire**, and **Unity Tutorials** repositories
- Linked all **legacy project repositories** in main legacy README

### 30.08
- Continued planning **Pseudo-Neuromorphic Sensor Framework**
- Consolidated **open questions** to address in upcoming work:
  - Target programming languages for broad microcontroller compatibility (Arduino Nano, ESP32, smaller models)
  - Optimal architecture and class design, informed by similar projects
  - Performance-oriented code structure
- Primary goals:
  - Maximize sensor polling rate
  - Allow manually adjustable spike detection for multiple sensor types (temperature, light, ultrasonic, pressure, laser distance, IMU)
  - Minimal code footprint for deployment on constrained microcontrollers
  - Flexible timing management for variable MCU clock rates
  - Standardized **output control**:
    - Mimic real neuromorphic sensor behavior for integration with ROS2 and other frameworks
    - Stable and intelligent output selection based on sensor type (single value vs. multi-array for IMU)

### 31.08
- Created issues for the new project
- Reorganized project outline for **modular, atomic framework design** to support "all" microcontrollers:
  - Arduino series, ESP32, and other common MCUs

## Key Insights

- Maintaining clean, well-structured repositories greatly reduces technical debt and simplifies onboarding for any future collaborators.
- Adding disclaimers and context for legacy code highlights learning progression and sets realistic expectations for code quality.
- Carefully planning modular, microcontroller-agnostic frameworks from the outset ensures maximum flexibility and long-term scalability.
- Regular issue tracking and incremental repository improvements streamline workflow and maintain project momentum.
- Even small documentation refinements, like TOC fixes and image adjustments, significantly improve usability and readability of project repos.

## Challenges & Fixes
- **Merge issues during final commit**  
  ✔ Resolved image paths, widths, and missing comments
- **Legacy code quality concerns**  
  ✔ Decided to upload executables instead of raw code for older projects
- **Balancing clarity and completeness in multiple READMEs**  
  ✔ TOC fixed, documentation refined across repositories

---

## Next Steps
- Address **open questions in Pseudo-Neuromorphic Sensor Framework**: programming language selection, class architecture, and performance optimization
- Begin implementation planning for modular framework targeting all common microcontrollers
