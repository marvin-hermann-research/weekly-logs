# Weekly Log – 2025-07-27

## Summary of Activities

### 20.07
- Wrote and published my first weekly log on GitHub to document the progress of my research journey  
- Completed the documentation of the `TreeFactory` setup – establishing a solid connection between `py_trees` and ROS2  
- Developed a first systematic understanding of Git issues and began using them productively  

### 21.07
- Finalized and documented the integration of ROS2 and `py_trees`  
- Released the first complete version of `ros_masterpost.md` and closed the corresponding issue  
- Expanded the project code: integrated `TreeFactory` and added condition nodes to support ROS publisher communication  

### 22.–24.07
- Created a new ROS package containing publisher nodes for action-based movement control  
- Developed the movement controller: subscribes to the action publishers and executes the commands  
- Major structural commit pushed to `main`: the foundational architecture is now in place  
- Created a new feature branch, completed the implementation of all action nodes, and integrated the movement controller  
- Established YAML integration: designed and finalized YAML files to define movement sequences  
- Initial commit to the feature branch – the complete pipeline from action nodes to execution through the movement controller is now functional  

### 27.07
- Documented the finalized YAML workflow within the `ros_masterpost.md`, outlining its role in defining and executing movement sequences via ROS2 and `py_trees`

## Key Insights

- The modular separation between `TreeFactory`, action nodes, and the external movement controller reinforces a clean division of responsibilities – a critical prerequisite for long-term maintainability and extensibility  
- My initial understanding of YAML in the context of movement execution was insufficient – the new, systematized structure now allows for consistent definition and execution of complex movement sequences within ROS

## Challenges & Fixes

- **Limited time this week**  
  Despite a demanding schedule, I was able to stay focused and make architectural progress in a targeted manner  

- **Immature YAML understanding within the movement module**  
  The original approach to controlling movements via YAML was too fragmented and inconsistent  
  ✔ **Fix:** Developed a new structure that integrates YAML as a declarative language for motion sequences in a consistent and scalable way within the ROS pipeline

## Next Steps

- Update Git issues to systematically track upcoming to-dos and refactoring needs  
- Finalize my ROS2 simulation project, including complete integration of behavior tree and sensor systems  
- Prepare a clean GitHub presentation of the project, including architecture visuals, showcase demos, and detailed documentation  
- Continue expanding and publishing my masterposts on ROS2 and Python, including design philosophies, modular code examples, and practical best practices
