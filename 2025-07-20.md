# Weekly Log – 2025-07-20

## Summary of Activities

### 05. – 13.07
- Initial setup and refinement of blog entries within the research hub repository

### 14.07
- Designed the foundational logic connecting `py_trees`, ROS2, and YAML-based movement patterns
- Implemented the first condition nodes for the behavior tree (BT) framework
- Developed a blackboard-writing ROS node (`CanWalkEvaluator`)

### 15.07
- Successfully integrated `py_trees` with ROS2
- Implemented ROS2 subscribers for IMU, LaserScan, and BatteryState
- Developed threshold-based logic to evaluate `can_walk` and write it to the blackboard
- Created condition nodes: `canWalk` and `mustWalk`
- Drafted `BehaviourCommandInterface` to write to `must_walk`
- Implemented first action nodes: `WalkForwardBehaviour` and `IdleBehaviour`
- Applied Python features such as `enumerate()`, `all()`, and list slicing to evaluator logic
- Reflected on Clean Code principles and the separation of concerns between evaluator and condition logic

### 16.07
- Launched my complete GitHub research portfolio: landing page, active projects, masterposts, and legacy archive
- Pushed the initial structure for weekly logs and thematic masterposts

### 17.07
- Deepened my understanding of Git (README, `.gitignore`, licensing, repository structure)
- Designed a package class diagram to clarify behavioral architecture
- Discovered `py_trees_ros2` as a ROS2-specific extension to `py_trees`
- Reflected on a moment of uncertainty: initially feared I had learned the wrong tools, but realized my approach was foundational and complementary to the larger system

### 18. - 19.07
- Started exploring `py_trees_ros2` and quickly reached a solid architectural understanding
- Built a mental model of its ticking, lifecycle synchronization, and blackboard interactions
- Extended both my `ros_masterpost.md` and `python_masterpost.md` to document this new knowledge

---

## Key Insights

- `py_trees_ros2` is not a replacement, but a critical ROS2 bridge layered on top of `py_trees`, my earlier learning was exactly the right foundation
- Explicit separation between evaluation logic and blackboard interfacing increases long-term modularity and maintainability

---

## Challenges & Fixes

- **Unaware of `py_trees_ros2` at first**  
  Initially assumed `py_trees` alone would be sufficient for ROS2 integration  
  ✔ **Fix:** After consulting the official documentation, I realized `py_trees_ros2` is the missing link, what I had built so far remains valid and essential groundwork

---

## Next Steps

- Finalize my ROS2 simulation project, including complete BT + sensor integration
- Showcase the project with a clean repository, demos, and architecture visuals
- Expand my Git literacy: using issues, todos, and PRs instead of relying solely on Obsidian
- Continue building and publishing my masterposts on `ROS2` and `Python`, including practical code snippets and design philosophies
